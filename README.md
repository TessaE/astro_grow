# Astro Grow

Check out this project at: https://tessae.github.io/astro_grow/


🌿 Project first created as part of HackDays at work - 2 days in which we get to hack at our own quick projects in order to learn new things & be creative.

🌻 First project created with Astro. I wanted to see what Astro was all about and whether it's worth the hype.

🍀 Most importantly: I really wanted a place to plan and organise my seed sowing/planting. It's hard work! I wanted to create something to help make that easier.
